som_test1_w5_TWN: clump size 8 - 16, so all grid=3x3


The study of factor timing, namely using the 6 alpha buckets and 7 BARRA risks:,
(see wiki writeup on Signal Timing via Manifold Learning)
som_train_{}.py:  
    1a, b, c, ..., f : weekly bucket forecasts based on factor performance
    2a - 2f: T-stat versions
    1a, 2f, 2g: BARRA factor forecast

Stock level information: 
- input: 6 bucket alphas for each stock, future raw returns

Strategy A:  alpha * RET
3a: daily traing: daily 6 bucket alpha, forecast next 1-day stock return. filter by weekday(). 
    limit 3x3 grid. still too much data and training time
3b: monthly runs: 6 bucket month alpha, forecast next month stock return. filter data to same weekday()
3c: remove weekday() filter. 
3d: lookback 6 months

Strategy B: alpha only (emulate David's result)
Input = bf.twn.expectAlpha_v2.monthly.train (generated by local jupyter 201703.som.stock.monthly)
3e: (7 month window) emulate David: 6 months Alpha for TWN
3eB: just the signals, for all country (bf.twn.expectAlpha_v3.monthly.train)
3f: 3e + extending window
3g: 3e + CurrRet column
3h: 3e + CurrRet column + extending window
3i: = 3eB

4a: TWN with input column standardize
4b: all CTY with standardize
